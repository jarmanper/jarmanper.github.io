        As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in
        my arms and set out walking once more. <span class="underline">I felt deeply
        moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was
        carrying a very fragile treasure.</span> <span class="highlight">It seemed to me, even,
        that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> In the
        moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed
        eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I
        said to myself: <span class="red-text">"What I see here is nothing but a
        shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a
        half-smile, I said to myself, again: <span class="red-text">"What moves me
        so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping
        here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose
        that shines through his whole being like the flame
        of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . ."</span> And I felt
        him to be more fragile still. <span class="underline">I felt the need of
        protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that
        might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .</span>
