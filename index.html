        <h3> About Me </h3>
        <p> Hello, my name is Jarman Perry, I am a second-year junior student
            here at NC A&T. I grew up mostly playing video games, so naturally,
            I felt a major with as much problem-solving as this would be most 
            beneficial to me. I plan to use my degree to solve problems in whichever
            field I can make a difference.</p>
